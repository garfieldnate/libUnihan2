Project libUnihan

This project provide a normalized SQLite Unihan database and corresponding C
library. All tables in this database are in fifth normal form.

The C API and the library is released under LGPLv2+, while the database is
released under Unicode Terms of Use (UCD, see
http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html for details).

There are three programs which provides not only database operation and query, 
but also examples that show how to use the libUnihan.

1. unihan_converter: Convert Unihan.txt to Unihan SQLite database.
2. unihan_field_validation: Verify the generated database using Unihan.txt.
3. unihan_query: Query on the database by SQL or given field value.

Normally 1 and 2 is not needed on a production system,
especially it tooks days to completed the unihan_test.

unihan_query, however, is a convenient way to access the database.

Examples:
Use as Chinese -> English dictionary.
unihan_query utf8 "<chineseCharacter>" kDefinition

Use as English -> Chinese dictionary (not perfect though).
unihan_query -L kDefinition "%<english word>%" utf8
