====== 2008-10-06 libUnihan 0.5.2 released ====
This release provides further support of ZhuYin and PinYin, such as
ZhuYin pseudo field, and new unihan_query options:  -Z, -z, -P, -p.

Now unihan_query is not only capable of showing the result fields, 
but also showing given fields with -O flags. Thus it will be more 
convenient for result checking, especially for SQL like  queries.

Test suite is now introduced into libUnihan. Many bugs have been found with it. :-)
