Unihan.db provides a Unihan character database in fifth normal form.
The original Unihan textual data is not normalized, and further parsing 
effort is needed to obtain data from compound values of Unihan "tags".
This database splits those tag value into atom fields, thus in most case
further parsing is not required. 

The Unihan.db is
released under Unicode Terms of Use (UCD, see
http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html for details).
